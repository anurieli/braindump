# Canvas Fixes Test Plan

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Immediate Idea Rendering Issue ✅
- **Problem**: New ideas don't appear until zoom/pan
- **Root Cause**: Stage.batchDraw() was not targeting the correct layer
- **Fix**: Changed to target the main content layer specifically: `layers[1].batchDraw()`

### 2. Broken Panning System ✅  
- **Problem**: Cursor changes to grab/grabbing but canvas doesn't move
- **Root Cause**: Stage draggable was set to `isPanning` creating chicken-and-egg problem
- **Fix**: Set Stage `draggable={true}` and added `stage.startDrag()` on Ctrl+click

### 3. Coordinate Transformation Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Viewport culling using wrong coordinate system
- **Root Cause**: Confused world vs screen coordinates in `getVisibleIdeas`
- **Fix**: Corrected viewport bounds calculation with proper coordinate conversion

## Test Instructions:

1. **Test Immediate Rendering**:
   - Click anywhere on canvas (not holding Ctrl)
   - New idea should appear immediately at click location
   - No need to zoom/pan to see it

2. **Test Panning**:
   - Hold Ctrl/Cmd and click-drag on canvas
   - Canvas should move smoothly
   - Cursor should change to grabbing during drag

3. **Test Idea Dragging**:
   - Click and drag existing ideas
   - Should move smoothly and persist position

4. **Test Coordinate Consistency**:
   - Pan around canvas
   - Click to create ideas in different viewport positions
   - Ideas should appear exactly where clicked
